(** HTTP client with Miou.

    A HTTP client using the Miou scheduler. It does a single HTTP request
    (though may follow redirects) to a remote uri. Both HTTP protocol 1.1 and
    2.0 are supported. Both http and https (via the pure implementation
    [ocaml-tls]) are supported. A connection is established via the
    happy-eyeballs algorithm if provided. *)

(** [request] attempts to send a request to [uri]. Several arguments can be
    defined by the user or left as default. Mandatory arguments are:
    - the [uri] target of the request
    - the function [fn] handling the content of the response
    - the value [acc] to be passed to the function [fn] handling the response
      content.

    You can specify the query method via the [meth] argument. By default, the
    [GET] method is chosen (see {!module:H2.Method.t} for more details).

    The user can specify fields (via [headers]) in addition to those added by
    [httpcats] - [httpcats] will never replace your defined fields. By default,
    [httpcats] attempts to set [User-Agent], [Host] (according to the given
    [uri]), [Content-Length] & [Connection] or [Transfer-Encoding] according to
    the [body] argument. [:authority] is also added if you wish to use version 2
    of the HTTP protocol.

    The user may want to send content (using [POST]). The user can specify a
    [body] value, which can be a simple [string] (see {!val:string}) or a stream
    of bytes (see {!val:stream}). In the latter case, a
    {i chunked transfer encoding} is preferred by [httpcats].

    It may happen that the resource is not directly accessible and that the
    server responds with a redirect. By default, [httpcats] follows redirects.
    It should be noted that, even if there is a redirect, the [body] will be
    sent. The user can:
    - not follow redirects, in which case [follow_redirect:false] must be
      specified
    - define an arbitrary number of redirects to follow (by default, [5]) using
      [max_redirect].

    Users can specify the protocol (via [config]) they want to use with the
    server. By default, [httpcats] handles [http/1.1] and [h2], but the user can
    force either protocol. At the same time, the user can also configure the
    size of the internal buffers used by the protocol implementation. [httpcats]
    will always use [http/1.1] if TLS is not used. [h2] is only available
    through TLS.

    Users can also configure TLS (version, ciphers used, etc.) via the
    [tls_config] option. The user can also specify the certificate acceptance
    policy via the [authenticator] argument to accept, for example, self-signed
    certificates.

    Finally, users can choose to use a pure OCaml DNS implementation to resolve
    domain names via a {i happy-eyeballs} resolver. *)
